## Presentation

The
[21<sup>st</sup> International Congress on Insurance: Mathematics and Economics (IME 2017)](https://fam.tuwien.ac.at/events/ime2017/),
scheduled July 3-5 2017, is one of the largest international meeting
series in actuarial science. The aim of the conference is *to
strengthen communication between individuals and groups who produce
and apply research results in insurance and finance, aiming to
integrate the currently fragmented research in both fields*.

The numerical and computational aspects play an ever increasing role
in the risk modeling and evaluation process. The *Computational
Actuarial Science with R* workshop aims to improve the general
programming skills of the participants and to expand their knowledge
of R for quantitative risk analysis.
