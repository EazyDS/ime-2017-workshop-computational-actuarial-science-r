# Computational actuarial science with R - IME 2017 Workshop

This archive contains the material needed for the *Computational
actuarial science with R* workshop of the 21st International Congress
on Insurance: Mathematics and Economics (IME 2017).

The workshop aims to improve the general programming skills of the
participants and to expand their knowledge of R for quantitative risk
analysis.

The workshop focuses on best practices and adopts a hands on approach
with lots of demonstrations and exercises. We first review the
basic notions of R programming from an actuarial perspective, study
the most important tools and learn to be efficient with the language.
Because it is an important topic for any programmer, we devote
some time to floating point numbers and roundoff error.

Based on a case study, the second part of the workshop follows a
typical risk analysis process: manipulation and modeling of insurance
data, estimation, measuring of risk, evaluation and simulation. In
closing, participants will learn to do more and be more effective in
their work with literate programming and version control.
